From master branch supports only local build and install.
To build distro specific packages [ex: rpm] checkout a release branch or tag.

Please git clone the source and follow the instruction mentioned below -
[For OL8: ./setup.sh followed by below commands]
To local build:
	./configure
	make all

To local build and install:
	./configure
	make install

To uninstall local build:
	[./configure]
	make uninstall

To clean temporary files:
	[.configure]
	make clean

To build rpm:
	Local Build:
	1. checkout a release branch or tag
	2. make clean;./configure
	3. make rpm
	[4. make rpm_clean]

	Similarly, code in master branch[latest unstable] can also be built.

	Jenkins Build:
	1. checkout a release branch or tag
	2. update the spec file [Release line] with bug# to customize the build name
	3. create a dev-build tag
		[Ex: git tag -a -m "build-dev" oled-tools-0.1-3.*]
	4. push build-dev tag to your personal repo
		[Ex: git push mbpatil oled-tools-0.1-3.* ]
	5. Check the jenkins/auto build area for created rpms

[Developer Work Flow]
	1. Checkout the release branch or tag to work on
	2. Update the spec file [Release line] with bug# to customize the build name
	3. Trigger a local/jenkins build [Make sure build happens]
	4. Work on your changes on this code base
	5. Once tested locally, send the patches for review
	6. Address the review commnets [go back to step 4 or proceed below]
	7. Push the patches to your personal repo and notify the maintainer to pull the changes

Additionally, If your patch is applicable to future releases -
	8. Re-stage your changes on master branch and test it
	9. Get your patches reviewed again, if the re-staged patch is different
	10. Push the patches to your personal repo and notify the maintainer to pull the changes

[Maintainer Role]
	1. Make sure pull requests have been reviewed and tested.
	2. Make sure master bug is present and addressed [to avoid forward porting to future releases]
	3. If pulled patches doesn't apply cleanly, ask the developer to re-stage the patches.
