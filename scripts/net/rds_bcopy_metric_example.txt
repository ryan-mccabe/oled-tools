Purpose: This script is used to trace and display the send/recv bytes per connection

Arguments: 

1) In UEK5/6/7 None
2) In UEK8
need "-D uek8" as macro optional value in command line.
Refer example below for UEK8

Output format: [<src-ip>,<dst-ip>,<tos> <send/recv>] <Data transfer rate in MB/s>

Sample output: Shown below

Example for UEK5/6/7:
